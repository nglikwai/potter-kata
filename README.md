# Potter Kata React App

This project is a solution to the **Potter Kata** problem, implemented in **React** with an interactive UI/UX.

## Algorithm

When designing the discount application solution, both the **Greedy algorithm** and **Backtracking** approaches were considered. Ultimately, the **Greedy algorithm** was chosen due to concerns about stack size and performance with larger datasets. Implementations of both approaches can be found in the src/utils/calculateDiscount.ts file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
